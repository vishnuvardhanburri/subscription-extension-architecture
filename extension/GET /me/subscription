The extension does not infer or store subscription state beyond a short-lived cache.

## Non-Responsibilities

The extension explicitly does NOT:
- Handle Stripe logic
- Store billing state
- Manage subscription lifecycle
- Persist sensitive user data
- Make entitlement decisions locally

---

## Design Principles

- Backend is the single source of truth
- Fail safely when entitlement is unclear
- Minimal client-side logic
- No reliance on cookies or third-party trackers
